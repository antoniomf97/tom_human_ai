        <p>
            In this study, you will be randomly and anonymously paired with another
            participant. One of you will be selected at random to be participant A,
            and the other will be participant B. You are going to play a sequential 
            game, that runs at most for {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a pot with value of {{ C.INITIAL_POT }} that will be shared among 
            the two participants. Starting with participant A, players will sequentially 
            make decisions on whether to take (<b>T</b>) the pot or to pass (<b>P</b>). 
            By choosing <b>T</b>, you will receive 80% of the current value of the pot, 
            while your opponent gets the remaining. Choosing <b>P</b> will increase the 
            pot by an amount of {{ C.POT_INCREMENT }} and its now your opponent's turn.
        </p>
        <p>
            When reaching the end, two endings are possible:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Fair-end:</b> both players receive 50% of the resource
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Zero-end:</b> both players receive a payoff of 0
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
